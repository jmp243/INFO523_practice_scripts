Part a (due Nov. 28): Review the book chapter! (PDF; max 2 pages; submission date 1; 10 points).
1.	What is the goal of the selected case study (e.g. predict X, classify N)?
In the case of detecting fraud, the goal was to identify anomalous cases that may have been fraudulent. The data was created based on the report of salespeople in a company. The goal here is to identify whether these reports have fraudulent information based on past reports (Torgo 2017, 295). 

2.	What do they expect you to practice by following the selected chapter? Was any of these aspects not covered in the course?

3.	What packages/tools did they use? 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(DMwR2)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
```

4.	In your own words, describe the overall analytical procedure followed in the chapter.

5.	Note that this book was first published in 2010. Before you explore their code in detail, answer: which aspects do you think you can easily improve on their analytical and methodological approach.

6.	What were the main conclusions of the chapter?
- Torgo (2016, p.304) - Torgo writes that the conclusions drawn from the data may be biased because some fraudulent purcheses were not detected. Data quality is a huge concern in this example of fraud detection.
