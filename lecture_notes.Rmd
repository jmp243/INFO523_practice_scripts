```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
functions in R. Functions will make processes much faster. 
basic syntax

fun <- function(args, ...) {
  out <- ...
  return(out)
}

```{r}
f1 <- function(x){
  a <- x^2 + 1
  return(a)
}

x<-2
a<-3
f1(x)
```
Trying to do another solution for the function problem

```{r}
# or another solution
bmi_calc <- function(df) {
  bmi <- weight/height
  formatted_bmi <- paste(format(round(bmi, 2)))
  return(formatted_bmi)
}

bmi_calc(R2)
```

bmi_calc(R2)

mapply 
```{r}
rep(1,4) # rep 1 four times
mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)

```
x and y 
```{r}
simplify <- function (u,v){
  (u + v) *2
}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
